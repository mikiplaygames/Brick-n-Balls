# Hello, this is simple project showcasing my first time meeting THE \~*Unity DOTS*\~

## So, the adventure was filled with uncertainty about where to go adn how to get there but eventually I managed to arrive in *some* form.

project looks like this:
![showcase_fullscreen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a63094-4638-451f-87c3-cf37e32e8cb9)
and with inspector opened:
![showcase_inspector](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb20e5f3-eb2c-4cec-b605-aab90e3584b3)

tbh, I like the end result for a first prototype

i sense that there are some things that could be improved but currently i lack the knowledge to do it well (will learn more to change that state) 

real work was somewhat about ~3h, research on the other hand, that took like ~12h :skull:

and here you can see *builder* design pattern (probably):
