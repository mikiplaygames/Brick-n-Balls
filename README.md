# Hello, this is simple project showcasing my first time meeting THE \~*Unity DOTS*\~

## So, the adventure was filled with uncertainty about where to go adn how to get there but eventually I managed to arrive in *some* form.

project looks like this:

and with inspector opened:

tbh, I like the end result for a first prototype

i sense that there are some things that could be improved but currently i lack the knowledge to do it well (will learn more to change that state) 

real work was somewhat about ~3h, research on the other hand, that took like ~12h :skull:








and here you can see *builder* design pattern (probably):
